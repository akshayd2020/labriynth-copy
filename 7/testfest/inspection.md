### TO-DO

- [20/20] accurate and helpful self-eval
- [10/10] descriptive todo-list items
> The to-do list is very well organized!

- [10/10] to-do item: "Strategy needs to know the last action of a GS..."
- [10/10] to-do item: observer "should be rendering after the game is over"
- [10/10] to-do item: "Ensuring all the home tiles are distinct"

### Revisions

- [10/10] a unit test that validates the implementation of the relaxation (board is not 7 x 7)
- [10/10] a unit test that validates the implementation of the relaxation (board is not square)
- [6/10] a unit test that validates that a board is suitabile for the given number of players
- [6/10] a unit that that rejects a board as too small for the given number of players
 > These two unit tests were not present, but you mentioned that in your self-eval (60%).

### Design

- [5/5pt] for ranking all three tasks with one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- [5/5pt] for using complete sentences for each explanation
- [5/5pt] for delivering acceptable explanations
