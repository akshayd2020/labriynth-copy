# Graphical User Interface

## Before the Game
Before the game, the player can input their name and age via the communication layer which can be accessed via the console. 
After a player is successfully into a game, the GUI can be displayed on the screen.

## During the Game
### The Board and the Spare
The GUI of this project will have a board and spare that are displayed on a users screen with only the information of the limited
game state, which includes the player's home position, current position, avatar, and other player's home positions, 
current positions and avatars. When it is the current players turn, the user will be given 2 choices in two buttons saying to either
pass or take a turn. A player should be able to try different moves on their end before choosing to pass or take a turn. 
A player is able to rotate the spare using their keyboard arrow keys, and will be able to shift specific rows by selecting rows 
or columns and moving them left/right or up/down. After the user inputs their rotated spare with a button that allows 
insertion, the board can display which positions that the current player can move their avatar to. 
After deciding whether to move their player or not, the user can either pass or click confirm move.

## After the Game
The score is displayed in the middle of the users GUI saying whether the user has won or lost.
